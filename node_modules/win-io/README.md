This is where [win-io](https://github.com/BrianGenisio/win-io) should be copied to. See [README](../README.md) for instructions.

win-io contains skeleton code for a Johnny-Five [IO plugin](https://github.com/rwaldron/io-plugins). 
For this project, win-io.js needs to modified (with the code from ..\patch.js) to add the ability to control the servos used in the hexapod.
